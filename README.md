## Overview

Online resume built with Jekyll & GitHub Pages. Viewable at
[btoone.github.com](https://btoone.github.io/).

Jekyll template forked from the [Resume
Template](https://github.com/jglovier/resume-template) engine.

## Local Development

Use Jekyll to serve the static site with the following command:

```bash
  bin/jekyll serve --livereload
```

Most changes should be done to the `_config.yml` file. Other content is in
`_data` and `_includes`.

## Overview

My resume online.

Made using the template engine https://github.com/jglovier/resume-template.

## Local Development

Use Jekyll to serve the static site with the following command:

```bash
  bin/jekyll serve --livereload
```

Most changes should be done to the `_config.yml` file. Other content is in
`_data` and `_includes`.
